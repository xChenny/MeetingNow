* Project Description

  I plan to make a scheduling service application similar to doodle.com. The following sections will
  describe the features and how I plan to implement the application on iOS.

** Critical Features

   - Allow users to copy a shareable code to the meeting scheduler "room".
   - Allow users to see a calendar with timeslots that people are available on.
   - Will notify participants if all of the people who were invited all submitted their availabilities.
   - Allow all participants to vote on a meeting time if there is are multiple.
   - Will allow the winning timeslot to be added to the calendar

** Lower-priority Features
   
   I will choose to do one or more of these features.
   
   - Users can choose/vote on a map for meeting place.
   - In-room chat for notifying participants

** Critical Frameworks

   1. *AlamoFire*: for making network requests to a server.
   2. *EventKit*: For accessing the calendar to add the event
   3. *Starscream*: Websocket Library. Send room-specific information to server

** Optional Frameworks

   I'll be using one or more of these depending on what feature I plan to implement. 

   1. *MapKit*: For displaying possible meeting locations (May not use this)
   2. *MessageKit*: For the chat (May not use this)
