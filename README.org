* 2nd Deliverable Update

  1. The currently completed features are at the bottom of this file under the "Current App/Server Progress" sections
  2. I have been pretty busy lately (with Senior Design, other classes, and whatnot), so my progress was slower than what was originally expected, but I finished a lot of the server requirements already.
  3. Currently, on the application side, I have many of the Storyboard Screens prototyped already, so I just have to code the logic.
  4. I have updated the timeline below to hopefully more accurately portray the expected completion of this project.

* Project Description

  I plan to make a scheduling service application similar to doodle.com. The following sections will
  describe the features and how I plan to implement the application on iOS.

** Critical Features

   - Allow users to register/login and persist their session using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
   - Allow users to copy/share a shareable key to join the meeting scheduler "room".
   - Allow users to see a calendar with timeslots that people are available on.
   - Will notify participants if all of the people who were invited all submitted their availabilities.
   - Allow all participants to vote on a meeting time if there is are multiple.
   - Will allow the winning timeslot to be added to the calendar

** Lower-priority Features
   
   I will choose to do one or more of these features.
   
   - Users can choose/vote on a map for meeting place.
   - In-room chat for notifying participants

** Critical Frameworks

   1. *AlamoFire*: for making network requests to a server.
   2. *EventKit*: For accessing the calendar to add the event
   3. *Starscream*: Websocket Library. Send room-specific information to server

** Optional Frameworks

   I'll be using one or more of these depending on what feature I plan to implement. 

   1. *MapKit*: For displaying possible meeting locations (May not use this)
   2. *MessageKit*: For the chat (May not use this)

** Implementation Notes:

   1. The unique key to join a room can simply just be the rooms id. This is probably not the best, but in our case, this should suffice.
